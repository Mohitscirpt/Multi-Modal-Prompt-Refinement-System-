Multi-Modal Prompt Refinement System

A system that accepts multi-modal inputs (text, images, documents, or their combinations) and transforms them into a standardized, structured, AI-ready prompt for downstream processing.

📌 Project Overview

In real-world scenarios, user inputs are often unstructured and inconsistent—ranging from plain text descriptions to images, sketches, and PDF documents.
This project solves that problem by refining diverse inputs into a unified prompt format, making them suitable for AI models and automation pipelines.

🎯 Objective

Accept multiple input formats

Extract meaningful information

Convert unstructured data into a clean, consistent, structured prompt

Ensure AI-ready output regardless of input type

🧩 Supported Input Types

✍️ Plain Text

🖼️ Images (sketches, screenshots, UI references)

📄 Documents (PDF, Word files)

🔀 Combination of all above

⚙️ Prompt Refinement Process

The system analyzes inputs and extracts:

Core Product Intent

Target Users

Functional Requirements

Technical Constraints (if provided)

Expected Outputs / Deliverables

Missing Information & Assumptions
